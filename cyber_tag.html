	<body><h1>Welcome to My Lasertag/Cybertag Project</h1>

    <p>I've created an interactive lasertag-themed game using components such as ESP8266, IR lasers, IR readers, and other hardware elements.</p>

    <p>The weapons are crafted from hand-worked wood, with specific components made of metal (such as rifle barrels) to enhance the realism and engagement of the experience.</p>

    <p>The game interface includes a server with scoreboards, and kill/death data is transmitted via LoRa. Each weapon features a screen displaying player statistics and remaining ammo.</p>

    <p>The initial prototype is a rifle, but there are also more compact versions like pistols, providing a variety of gaming experiences.</p>

    <p>The project is designed as a simulated lasertag experience, entirely safe and dedicated to entertainment.</p>
